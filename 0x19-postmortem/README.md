Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours
Start Time: 2024-01-21 14:00 WAT
End Time: 2024-01-21 18:00 WAT
Impact: Significant degradation of the user authentication service, affecting 30% of users attempting to log in.
Timeline:

13:45 WAT: Unusual spike in error rates detected via automated monitoring.
13:50 WAT: Engineer on-call alerted by automated monitoring system.
13:55 WAT: Initial investigation started, focusing on the authentication service and server logs.
14:15 WAT: Assumption made that the issue might be related to recent code deployment.
14:30 WAT: Deployment logs analyzed, no anomalies found. Investigation shifted to database connectivity.
15:00 WAT: Misleading assumption made about a potential database server overload; additional database resources allocated.
16:00 WAT: Error rates persist. Investigation escalated to the database team.
16:30 WAT: Database team identifies a network misconfiguration affecting database connections.
17:00 WAT: Corrective measures applied to fix the network misconfiguration.
18:00 WAT: User authentication service fully restored, error rates return to normal.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The issue originated from a misconfiguration in the network settings of the database, causing intermittent failures in establishing connections. This misconfiguration was not caught during the pre-deployment testing due to a lack of specific network-related test scenarios.

Resolution: The network misconfiguration was corrected by adjusting the database's network settings to align with the application's requirements. Additionally, a thorough review of the network configurations for all critical components was performed to preemptively identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Strengthen network configuration testing during pre-deployment checks.
Enhance monitoring alerts to include specific checks for database connectivity issues.
Implement automated rollback procedures for deployments in case of unexpected issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Network Configuration Audit:

Conduct a comprehensive audit of all network configurations for critical services.
Implement regular automated checks for network configurations to detect anomalies.
Testing Enhancements:

Integrate network-specific test scenarios into the pre-deployment testing process.
Establish a protocol for testing the scalability and resilience of network configurations.
Monitoring Improvements:

Enhance monitoring systems to include specific alerts for database connectivity issues.
Implement proactive alerting for potential network misconfigurations.
Documentation Update:

Review and update documentation regarding network configuration best practices.
Document lessons learned from this incident to improve incident response procedures.
